# Origamid's React Course Final Project - Dogs (with TS)

This project I made using `Typescript`, differently from the [course]("https://www.origamid.com/curso/react-completo/"), which was made with `Javascript`.
Dogs is a social network made for dogs. Hmm... actually it was made for dogs owners. Try it out right now.
