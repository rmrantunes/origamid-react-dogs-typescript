# Origamd's React Course Final Project - Dogs (with TS)

This project I made using `Typescript`.
Dogs is a social network made for dogs. Hmm... actually it was made for dogs owners. Try it out right now.

## Get started with this project

To see this project working, run:

### `yarn`

To install all dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
